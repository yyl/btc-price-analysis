## 0. Motivation

Motivate more: why BTC price prediction is different from regular stock price prediction. As from [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know):

> The price of a bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets. Consequently, keeping your savings with Bitcoin is not recommended at this point. 

Our first objective is to see if the common algorithms that work well on regular price prediction still works on BTC price.
